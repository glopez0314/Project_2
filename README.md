#PROJECT 2

This project is a representation of a full-crud based app on mongoDB. The app is meant to allow people to review games themselves and build a reputation of being accurate so others can find a favorite reviewer of their’s that they trust. So they can see if they reviewed a game they’ve been eyeing.
